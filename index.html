                theme-based circuits.
                Through this policy, which offers operators the “Right
                of Use” of its rakes and infrastructure, the Railways
                has liberalized and simplified a part of operations
                that was otherwise carried out mostly by the Indian
                Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).
                While any entity can run these trains, including state
                governments, it is implied that the policy is targeted
                at tour operators.
                The train will make stops at Tiruppur, Erode, Salem,
                Yelahanka, Dharmavaram, Mantralayam Road, and
                Wadi before ending its journey in the holy town of
